Readme: 

models folder contain two models

1. finalized_model1.sav for logistic regression approach (61.2 MB)

2. final_modelrnn.pt for RNN based approach (132 MB)

3. used a pretrained embedding of wiki 300 so u need to either run on colab or download it before execution


# github is not allowing to upload 2nd model because of its size.

# the whole work is done on colab so if for any issues refer original files of colab (rnn_snli.ipynb)
